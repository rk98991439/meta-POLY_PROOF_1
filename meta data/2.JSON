{"name":"In a quiet coastal village","description":"In a quiet coastal village, a weathered lighthouse stands tall on the rocky shore. The sun sets behind it, casting a warm, golden glow on the water. Seagulls soar in the sky, and a fishing boat returns to the harbor, its sails painted with colors that mirror the vibrant hues of the sunset. The village cottages, with their thatched roofs and flower-filled gardens, create a picturesque scene that evokes a sense of nostalgia and serenity. The air is filled with the scent of saltwater and blooming flowers, transporting you to a simpler time.
